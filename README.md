# Park Directories
Park (bookmark) directories so that we can quickly navigate
to them from anywhere else using a short reference name.
The references persist across bash sessions.

usage: pd [OPTION] [REF]

-d, --del NAME  Remove the directory referenced by NAME
-l, --list      Display the entire list of parked directories
-c, --clear     Clear the entire list of parked directories

examples:
    pd dev      Navigate to directory saved with the ref name dev
    pd -a dev   Park the current directory with the ref name dev
    pd -d dev   Remove the directory referenced by the name dev from
                the parked directories list

Parked directories are stored in $HOME/.pd-data by default.
